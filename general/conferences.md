# Conferences of interest for what we do

## EMP-E, Energy Modelling Platform for Europe

**In brief**: yearly conference in which European energy system modellers meet among themselves and with officers from the European Commission to present and discuss the latest findings. The conference is always hosted by an ongoing energy modelling project funded by the Commission. In 2022, it will be ECEMF.

**What you can present**: usually, you can either share a poster or present it in an actual session. Sometimes other options (e.g., video posters) are available.

**Publishing options**: usually, the best works can be invited for publication in a Special Issue of a good-quality Elsevier journal.

**Next chance to participate**: 2022 (date yet to be communicated; last year, it was the end of September)

## Open Energy Modelling Initiative (OpenMod) workshops

**In brief**: yearly workshops in which energy modellers and open-source enthusiasts, typically within Europe, meet to present their latest works and collaborate on some practical, common challenges (e.g., how to model something, where to get specific data). Since covid, no in-person workshop has been organised, but some “mini-workshops” have been held online. It is a very informal, self-organised (each time by a different institution) event.

**What you can present**: usually, you can either share a poster or present it in an actual session. Sometimes other options (e.g., video posters, lightning talks) are available. When collaborative sessions are foreseen, you may also propose a session and lead it.

**Publishing options**: none. 

**Next chance to participate**: 2022 or 2023 (there has been an online mini-workshop in February 2022; not clear if there will be anything else this year)

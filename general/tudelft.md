# General tips and tricks for TU Delft

* __Web applications__: Most internal web applications (timesheets, expenses, travel, courses...) are linked from the [intranet landing page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/).

* __Remote Windows desktop__: it is possible to access a remote Windows 10 desktop with some private storage space and many licensed applications (e.g. Adobe, Office) already installed, via a web-based software called 'Citrix'. Just log in with your NetID and password [here](https://weblogin.tudelft.nl/). Make sure you limit your use to when necessary and log out of Citrix when done, as the university has limited licenses.

* __Be aware of the many options for Open Access publishing__: TU Delft covers the full article processing charge for all of Elsevier's 'hybrid' journals (i.e. those allowing both Gold Open Access publishing and conventional, paywalled publishing) and for the vast majority of fully open acess journals from any publisher (e.g. PLOS ONE). Check out this [page](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/open-access-funding) for all the details, or simply browse your preferred journal [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/journal-browser) and check whether it is covered.

* __Applying for reimbursement of travel & accomodation expenses__ (e.g., for a conference): You have to apply for a foreign trip via a web system called "Digiforms". [This intranet page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/group/guest/-/international-business-trip?p_l_back_url=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddienstreis) provides all the necessary information about business trips. In short, the Digiforms portal will ask for the date and purpose of the trip and for an estimation of the expenses (by cost voice, e.g., travel, accomodation, food, etc.). This needs to be a rough estimate and not the exact amount that you will be ultimately reimbursed (which could vary, for instance, based on the actual expenses for food or public transport which you can only roughly estimate beforehand). You can also ask for 75% of the estimated expenses to be paid to you in advance, provided that such 75% of the total estimated costs is higher than 250 Euros. Finally, you need to ask you daily supervisor which Baancode or Projectcode you can use as a financial source.
